## How Chroma, Letta, and Claude Work Together

**Updated in context.md to show complementary roles (NOT contradictory):**

### Claude (Anthropic)
**Role:** Real-time understanding and response generation
**What it does:**
- Analyzes patient messages RIGHT NOW
- Understands intent, emotion, urgency
- Generates appropriate responses
- Detects emergencies

### Letta (Cloud)
**Role:** Long-term memory and pattern recognition
**What it stores:**
- Patient preferences (name, communication style)
- Behavioral patterns (response times, reliability)
- Health patterns (recurring mentions)
- Family context

### Chroma (Vector DB)
**Role:** Semantic search engine
**What it enables:**
- Find conversations by MEANING, not just keywords
- Search: "knee pain" → finds "leg hurts", "trouble walking", "knee bothering"
- Provide evidence for Letta's patterns
- Power dashboard search feature

### How They Collaborate (Not Duplicate):
1. **Patient says:** "I'm feeling dizzy"
2. **Letta provides:** "Patient has dizziness pattern, usually afternoons, often dehydration"
3. **Chroma provides:** "Here are the 5 specific past conversations about dizziness"
4. **Claude analyzes:** Uses both Letta's pattern + Chroma's evidence → Generates informed response
5. **Result:** Better care through complementary AI capabilities

**Key Insight:**
- Letta = Abstract patterns ("patient tends to...")
- Chroma = Concrete evidence ("here are the specific times...")
- Claude = Real-time understanding with full context

## Important Reminders

### For Claude Code (AI Assistant):

1. **Always check these documents** before starting work:
   - `architecture.md` - Understand how components interact
   - `file-structure.md` - Know where to add code
   - `context.md` - Full project requirements

2. **Update file-structure.md** whenever you:
   - Add new files
   - Remove files
   - Reorganize directories

3. **Reference postman-collections.md** when:
   - Testing API endpoints
   - Need to know request/response formats

4. **Check deployment.md** before:
   - Deploying to Railway/Vercel
   - Configuring external services

### For Developers:

1. **Start here:** Read this README first for navigation
2. **Understand architecture:** Read architecture.md
3. **Before coding:** Check file-structure.md to know where code goes
4. **Testing:** Use postman-collections.md to test your work
5. **Deploying:** Follow deployment.md step-by-step
